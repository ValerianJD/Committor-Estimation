# Committor Estimation
 A set of codes to estimate the committor function on conceptual models.

The four basic methods: Analogue Markov Chain, FeedForward Neural Network, Dynamical Galerkin Approximation, Reservoir Computing.

Also included the codes to automatically run these methods with any parameters and generate the comparison plots.

The implementation of the AMOC box model and double-gyre model are also included, as well as all necessary files to run them.
